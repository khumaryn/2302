            <div id="1"><p>The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.</p></div>
            <div id="2" class="display"><p>While adult male lions consume 16 pounds or more of meat daily, mature female lions only require about 11 pounds. They have been found to hunt rodents, birds, rabbits, lizards, and tortoises in addition to the larger herbivores like zebra, antelope, and buffalo. The majority of the pride hunters are lionesses. </p></div>
            <div id="3" class="display"><p>Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride. The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered groups that may unite to hunt or share a meal. </p></div>
